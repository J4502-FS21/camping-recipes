      <h2> Why even camp? </h2>

      <p>In an age where staying inside seems to be the norm and technology continues to rule our daily lives, it’s rare that we get to go outside and just relax in nature. Whether you’re going for a hike by yourself or a partner for exercise, tenting with family to reconnect and build a stronger relationship, or even challenging your natural instincts by going on a solo mission, camping in the outdoors is a fun way to be one with nature. So put on your favorite playlist, light a fire, and bring a good book because we are heading to the outdoors. </p>

      <h2> What do the tabs mean? </h2>

      <p>No one camping experience is exactly like another. Sometimes you find yourself backpacking with a limited number of supplies to carry. Other times, you can pull your car right up to the lot loaded with an ice chest full of food and drinks. For each tab, I have provided a recipe that falls under one of three separate categories: ‘Bare Bones,’ ‘Just Enough,’ and ‘A Feast.’ Each tab contains a definition for the categories along with other recipe ideas. Just because you only have a zip-lock bag of ingredients doesn’t mean that you need to have a bland meal. And no, ramen noodles will not be included in any recipe.</p>

      <h2>About me. </h2>

        <p> My name is Cam Denmark, I am a second-year grad student at the University of Missouri. Currently studying data journalism, which is essentially traditional journalism practices with an emphasis on data analysis, I hope to one day work in some data or statistics capacity with a professional sports team. I also love to cook, and I love to be outside. For this website, I figured, why not create a website that combines the two?  </p>

        <p> I have gone camping with my dad and stepmom for years. However, their definition of camping is significantly tailored to the 21st century idea of “camping.” In fact, we call it glamping, or glorified camping. We set up a massive RV at some random site complete with a full size kitchen, shower, and enough room to sleep around 12 people (trust me we have done it before, it isn’t pretty). I do not enjoy this method of camping; it is too easy and seems more to be an excuse to drink around a fire at a location different from home. So, whenever I get the chance, I take my tent, fishing pole, and portable grill and do it the “real” way. Or at least, a bit more “real” than my dad’s way. </p>
