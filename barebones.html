      <p>Let’s set the scene, you’re getting the itch to be in the outdoors, but you have little time to run the store and get ingredients for a meal. You’re wanting to get outside after all. You grab a few things from your cupboards, a knife, a pan, and fishing pole. After getting hooked onto a fish, you’re finally excited for a delicious meal. But you don’t want just fish over the fire again, too boring. This recipe is tailed to those who only want to carry a zip lock bag full of ingredients but want to make a delicious meal with their catch.</p>
  <h2 id="barebonesrecipetitle">Simple fish curry</h2>
  <div class="barebonesparagraph">
      <p>The best part about this recipe is its versatility. Not only that, but it is surprisingly quick and stupidly easy. If you have extra ingredients such as vegetables, curry paste, or even if you wish to bypass the fish altogether and add tofu, chicken, or shrimp, throw it in to this non fussy curry. Keep in mind that whatever protein you put in must be cooked fully before you eat it.</p>

         <ul>
           <li>Two fillets of white fish, cut into bite sized chunks</li>
<li>Two cloves of garlic</li>
<li>Thumb of ginger</li>
<li>Two dried chilis (half a fresh one if using something like a jalapeño)</li>
<li>One 14 oz can unsweetened coconut milk</li>
<li>Two tablespoon curry powder</li>
<li>One tablespoon turmeric</li>
<li>Lime</li>
</ul>
</p>

  <ol>
    	<li> Place 10-inch pan on medium flame and let get up to temp. Place in a tablespoon of oil or butter once hot.</li>
<li> While waiting for the pan to heat up, peel and chop garlic, ginger, and chili.</li>
<li>	Add in garlic, ginger, and chili and sauté until fragrant and garlic turns golden, about one minute.</li>
<li>	Add in curry powder and turmeric, fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
<li>	Stir in coconut milk, combine flavors.</li>
<li>	Let curry come up to a simmer, let sit for 4-5 minutes. If cooking over open flame, adjust pan to cooler part of fire so it doesn’t boil over.</li>
<li>	Place fish in, let simmer until cooked through and flaky. Depending on the fish, this will take anywhere between 10-15 minutes.</li>
<li>	Take pan off heat. Garnish with lime juice.</li>
<li>	Dig in.</li>
