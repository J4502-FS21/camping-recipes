  <h1 id="afeasttitle">A Feast</h1>
    <div class="afeastparagraph">
      <p>You drove up the car to the site and you have a cooler full of everything you could possibly need for a large meal. This recipe is designed to please a very large crowd that is eager for a good meal. I tried to go with a recipe that can be adapted in almost any circumstance. Even if you aren’t in the bush, this is still a great meal to whip up at home.

  <h2 id="afeastrecipetitle">Chicken Fried Rice</h2>
  <div class="afeastparagraph">
      <p>It doesn’t need to be chicken, it can be steak, tofu, fish, even just plain old egg. Fried rice is a staple in, not just my camping diet but my weekly diet as well. I love to use brown rice to keep it healthy. But if white rice is your thing, go for it friend. Use a wok if you can, if not, just a 12-inch frying pan with big slopping sides will do.</p>

  <div class="flex-item">
    <div class="info-container">
      <p><ul>
        <li>One chicken breast, cut into large chunks</li>
<li>Two cups cooked rice</li>
<li>One clove minced garlic</li>
<li>Half a red onion</li>
<li>Two carrots chopped</li>
<li>A third cup peas</li>
<li>A quarter cup cpring onion</li>
<li>Soy sauce</li>
<li>Sesame oil</li>


</ul></p>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>Crack 2 eggs. Beat it well. </li>
<li>Heat up the wok. Add about 1 tbsp of vegetable oil. Give it a toss, so the bottom is coated nicely. </li>
 <li>Wait until there is smoke coming out. Pour in the egg. Will take about 30-50 seconds to get it fluffy. Break it into small pieces and set it aside.</li>
<li>Add more oil into the same wok. Heat it up and add in the chicken. Saute it about 1 or 2 minutes. Then push it to the side so you have room for the vegetables. Dump in all your veggies.</li>
<li>When the onions turn clear add salt to taste. Clear out pan.</li>
<li>Heat up the wok for about 15 seconds. Then add 2 tbsp of vegetable oil. Put in the rice right after that. Use your spatula to break down the big pieces.</li>
<li>Stir fry for two minutes then add seasonings, soy sauce and sesame oil.</li>
<li>Add in rest of ingredients to heat back up.</li>
