    <div class="justenoughparagraph">
      <p>You’ve got just enough to make yourself and your friends a decent size meal. Perhaps you have carried a cooler to the site full of meat, vegetables and you’re ready to make a solid dinner or lunch. These meals cover just that, perhaps not a ton of ingredients that would define “a feast,” but certainly more than just the “bare bones.”

  <h2 id="justenoughrecipetitle">Sausage Peppers and Onions</h2>
  <div class="justenoughparagraph">
      <p>You absolutely cannot go wrong with sausage peppers and onions. Whether served on a plate by itself or in a hoagie roll, this meal can easily please a crowd. If you are cooking over an open fire, put your sausage on a stick and cook it caveman style if you wish. Just remember that the outside will burn quicker than the inside will cook. So make sure you don’t hold it too close to the fire.</p>
